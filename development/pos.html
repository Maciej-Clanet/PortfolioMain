                        <h2 id="The_Tech" class="heading-text article-heading">The Tech</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">
                            We have carefully selected our tech stack based on the goals of the software, as well as the
                            environment it will be run in.<br><br>
                            On the <b>back-end</b> side, we have used <b>Rust</b>. There are few reasons for this.</p>


                        <h3 id="The_Speed" class="paragraph-text article-subheading">The Speed</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Our primary target audience are small restaurants. The software is
                            also running on a single server, to which multiple terminals can connect to over a local
                            network.<br>
                            We wanted to make sure that the restaurants would not be forced to buy expensive hardware in
                            order to run our system. For this reason we need a high performance language like Rust.</p>
                        <h3 id="The_Reliability" class="paragraph-text article-subheading">The Reliability</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">One of the worse case scenarios that could happen to our system, is it
                            crashing in the middle of a busy shift, taking down the restaurant ability to take orders.
                            Because of this, we need to make sure our code will never crash, and extensively test it for
                            bugs.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Rust helps a lot here. The Rust language is known for extensive error
                            handling functionalities, which we take full advantage of. Furthermore rust is a compiled
                            language, which helps us catch errors early, before they have the chance to cause any damage
                            or be missed.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">The choice of <b>database</b> was also very important.
                            We had a few restrictions in our choice. One of our goals is to keep the bundle size tiny,
                            and make the setup process as fast and easy as possible. We needed a database that is fast,
                            small, and easy to embed directly into the application.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">We eventually landed on <b>Indradb</b>, a graph database written in
                            rust. This is a little known database, but it has ticked all of our requirements. In some
                            ways it’s also our biggest mistake, as this database is extremely hard to work with.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">On the <b>front-end</b> side, we use <b>React</b> with
                            <b>Typescript</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">It is my belief that React is often not the best choice. A lot of
                            websites and products would be better of using a lightweight system like HTMX, instead.
                            However when it comes to complex systems with a lot of interactivity, bulkier component
                            based frameworks like React become useful. Our application has a highly complex user
                            interface with a lot of interactivity. There are a lot of menus, sub menus, settings,
                            builders, toggles, and more.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-text">The choice for using <b>typescript</b> instead of plain JS was simple,
                            reliability. Having types allows a higher degree of code reliability, ability to catch bugs
                            early, and the extra benefit of auto complete from having defined types improves the dev
                            experience and speed.</p>
